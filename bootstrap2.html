            <p class="paragraph">With the proliferation of information technology in first-world countries during past decades, millions of people now have access to vast amounts of online data.</p><br>
            <p class="paragraph"> The internet is a powerful tool that is taken for granted by many people in Canada; it is used frequently for social networking, emails, casual and academic research, and shopping to name a few. But while Canadians enjoy the benefits of technology, billions of people in far-away countries have no such privilege.</p><br>
            <p class="paragraph">Africa, South and Central America, the Middle-East, Central and South-Asia and the Pacific are traditionally underdeveloped when it comes to the field of information-technology. Basic infrastructure such as computers and even internet connections are not available in many communities; as a result, well over half the world&#8217s population has no computer literacy skills and is cut off from a huge amount of information.</p><br>
